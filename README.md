The Simple Banking System is a robust desktop application developed using Java and the Swing framework, designed to simulate essential financial operations such as depositing, withdrawing, and transferring funds in real-time. It features a secure login and registration interface that auto-generates unique account numbers, complemented by a modern, user-friendly dashboard with intuitive sidebar navigation. Beyond basic transactions, the system includes advanced utilities like "Forgot Password" recovery and a dedicated Admin Panel for comprehensive user management. A key technical highlight is its implementation of Data Persistence via File I/O, ensuring that user records and detailed transaction histories are saved permanently even after the application closes. By leveraging Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles and robust data validation, this project provides a seamless and professional digital banking experience without the complexity of an external database.
